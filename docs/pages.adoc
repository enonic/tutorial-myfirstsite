= Visualize your content with pages

For every page, there is always a page component. 

== Page component
At the moment, we have some content, but no preview or visual rendering.

Pages are composed from one or more components.

Your app includes a pre-defined page component named `hello`. It is defined by a descriptor file, placed in a particular location within your app:

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.xml
[source,js]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.xml[]
----

TIP: Like content types, you can define a form for the component using the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas[schema system].

== Component controller

Enonic supports rendering with 3rd party front-ends, but is also capable of rendering by itself thanks to the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework[JS framework], which we will be using throughout this tutorial.

When rendering with the Enonic framework, each component may have its very own controller, responsible for rendering it. Here is what it looks like in our case: 

NOTE: The controller file must use the same name as the component directory.

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.ts
[source,js]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.ts[]
----

NOTE: Here we're using TypeScript. Each .ts file will automatically be compiled, and a .js file placed in the same folder. XP uses the resulting .js file.

== Templating

For clean coding, we have also supplied a simple HTML template - a.k.a the View in the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. It look like this:

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html[]
----

NOTE: This view is plain HTML, but also uses a specific syntax known as the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/thymeleaf-lib[Thymeleaf^] templating language. The Enonic runtime also supports many other options, such as https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-lib[React^], https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/mustache-lib[Mustache^] and https://market.enonic.com/vendors/tineikt/freemarker-xp-library[Freemarker^]


== Create page

For the `hello` page component render something, it must be associated with a content item:

. Select the Site content item -  `Hello World` and click btn:[edit]
. From the preview panel on the right, select the `Hello` page component in the list. Your changes will automatically save, and the page preview will render the result.

TIP: To learn more about pages, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/pages[pages] documentation.

== Summary

At this point we were able to attach a hello page component to the hello-world site content, which is great!

A good reader will note the page is not static, i.e, it will ouput a `displayName` followed by a hardcoded text ` - we made it!`... but that's it.

Next you'll be introduced to the <<concept of regions>>, that will enable you to add more components to your pages.
