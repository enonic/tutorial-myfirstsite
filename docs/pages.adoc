Visualize your content with pages

NOTE: Using the headless API, Enonic supports use 3rd party front-end frameworks. Enonic also provides an embedded JavaScript runtime, and a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework[JS framework], which we will use for rendring here. 


== Page component
At the moment, we have some content, but no preview or rendering.

Pages are essentially composed from one or more components. Using the Enonic framework, each component will have a JavaScript controller which is responsible for rendering it. Your app includes a pre-defined page component named `hello`.

In addition to the controller, this component also uses an html template - a.k.a the View in the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. It look like this:

TIP: The JavaScript controller file must use the same name as the component directory.

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.ts
[source,js]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.ts[]
----

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html[]
----

NOTE: The view is plain HTML, but also uses a specific syntax known as the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/thymeleaf-lib[Thymeleaf^] templating language. The Enonic runtime also supports many other options, such as https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-lib[React^], https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/mustache-lib[Mustache^] and https://market.enonic.com/vendors/tineikt/freemarker-xp-library[Freemarker^]


== Create page

To actually have the `hello` page component render something, it must be associated with a content item:

. Select the site content `Hello World` and click btn:[edit]
. From the preview panel on the right, select the `Hello` page component in the list. Your changes will automatically save, and the page preview will render the result.

TIP: To learn more about pages, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/pages[pages] documentation.

== Summary

At this point we were able to attach a hello page component to the hello-world site content, which is great!

A good reader will note the page is not static, i.e, it will ouput a `displayName` followed by a hardcoded text ` - we made it!`... but that's it.

Next you'll be introduced to the <<concept of regions>>, that will enable you to add more components to your pages.
