== Pages

At the moment, we have some content, but no preview or rendering.

As a headless CMS, Enonic supports use 3rd party front-ends, but Enonic also has an an embedded JavaScript runtime, and a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework[JS framework]. 

This can be used to customize the platform, or, like in our case render pages for a website.

Pages are essentially composed from one or more components. Using the Enonic framework, each component will have a JavaScript controller which is responsible for rendering it.

=== Page component

The app includes a pre-defined page component named `hello`.

In addition to the controller, this component also uses an html template - a.k.a the view in the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. They look like this:

TIP: The JavaScript controller file must use the same name as the component directory.

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.ts
[source,js]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.ts[]
----

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html[]
----

NOTE: The view is plain HTML, but also uses a specific syntax known as the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/thymeleaf-lib[Thymeleaf^] templating language. The Enonic runtime also supports many other options, such as https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-lib[React^], https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/mustache-lib[Mustache^] and https://market.enonic.com/vendors/tineikt/freemarker-xp-library[Freemarker^]


=== Create page

To actually have the `hello` page component render something, it must be mapped to a content item:

. Select the site content `Hello World` and click btn:[edit]
. From the preview panel on the right, select the `Hello` page component in the list. Your changes will automatically save, and the page preview will render the result.

== Summary

At this point we were able to attach a hello page component to the hello-world site content, which is great!

A good reader will note the page is not completely static, i.e, it will ouput a `displayName` followed by a hardcoded text ` - we made it!`... but that's it. Even though it is not static, it doesn't do much.

Next you'll be introduced to the conecept of regions, that will enable your pages to receive other components making it rich and dynamic.
