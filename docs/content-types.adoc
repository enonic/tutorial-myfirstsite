== Content Types

Every content item has a specific a content type.

Enonic XP ships with a set of standard content types such as `Shortcut`, `Folder`, `Site` and a range of `Media Types` that handle different kind of files.

Additionally, an application may define custom content types.
In our case, the content types `Country` and `City` already exist in the application.

In Content Studio, the `City` content type looks something like this:

image::city-form.png["Form for the city content type", width=1024px]

The content type is defined in a file, looking like this:

.src/main/resources/site/content-types/city/city.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/resources/site/content-types/city/city.xml[]
