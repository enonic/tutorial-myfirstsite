= Static assets

Add static assets like icons, css and JavaScript to your website

== Serving a CSS file

So far, the site is primarily made up of dynamic HTML and images.
Let's have a look at how to handle static assets. In our case, we'll use a CSS file.

Enonic supports an "out-of-the-box" solution for this through the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/asset-service[Asset service]. By simply placing files in the `src/resources/assets` folder - they are instantly available on a specific URL.

Your application already includes the sample asset `src/main/resources/assets/mvp.css`. Let's put it to work by injecting it to the page component:

**Update your page component view** with the following content:

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-static/hello.html[]
----

There are only two changes in this file, one line that includes the css file, and a small attribute on the html element to activate dark mode support.

If you're using `dark mode`, the result will look something like this:

image::css.png["Countries page in dark mode after adding the css", width=1024px]

== Perfect cache
When running Enonic XP in production, every asset will include cache headers that let proxies/CDNs and browsers cache it - without ever having to download it again.

*How does it work?*

The generated asset URL will contain a prefix based on a signature of the files in the app. The signature will change with every new version of the app. The `portal.assetUrl()` function uses this signature when generating the URL, ensuring that clients always get the most recent version.

NOTE: When running in dev mode (like you do now), cache headers are deactivated

=== Lib static

If you're using advanced build-tools like Webpack, assets may be chunked and served incrementally. Changing the URL to **all** assets for every re-deploy is no longer optimal. You can take full control over asset serving by adding https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/static-asset-lib[Lib static^] to your app.

Lib-static is pre-bundled with selected app starters like the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/tsup-starter[Tsup Starter^] and https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-starter[React4XP starter^].

== Summary

The journey on this docs so far provided you a starting ground to build your first website. Let's now take a look on how you can <<go-online#, publish everything and go online>>!
