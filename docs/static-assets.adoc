== Static assets

So far, the site is made up of dynamic HTML and images.
Let's have a look at how to handle static assets like graphics, CCS and JavaScript files.

Enonic supports an "out-of-the-box" solution for this through the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/asset-service[Asset service].
By simply placing files in the `src/resources/assets` folder - they are instantly available on a specific URL.

Your application already includes the sample asset `assets/mvp.css`.
Let's put it to work by adding the CSS to the page component:

**Update your page component view** with the following content:

.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-static/hello.html[]
----

There are only two changes in this file, one line that includes the css file, and a small attribute on the html element to activate dark mode support.

If you're using `dark mode`, the result will look something like this:

image::css.png["Countries page in dark mode after adding the css", width=1024px]

=== Perfect cache
In production, every asset will include cache headers that allow CDNs and browsers to cache it - and never need to download it again.

How does it work?
The generated asset URL will contain a prefix based on a signature of the files in the app. The signature will change with every new version of the app.
The `portal.assetUrl()` function uses this signature when generating the URL, ensuring that clients always get the most recent version.

NOTE: When running in dev mode (like you do now), cache headers are deactivated

=== Lib static

If you're using advanced build-tools like Webpack, assets may be chunked and served incrementally. Changing the URL to **all** assets for every re-deploy is no longer optimal.

For this purpose, you can take full control over asset serving by adding https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/static-asset-lib[Lib static^] to your app.

We will not go into details in this tutorial, but lib-static is pre-bundled with selected app starters like https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/webpack-starter[Webpack Starter^] and https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-starter[React4XP starter^].
