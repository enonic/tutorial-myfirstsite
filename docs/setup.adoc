== Install Enonic CLI

The Enonic CLI (Command Line Interface) is an essential tool for developing with Enonic.

If you have `npm` on your device, run this command:

  npm install -g @enonic/cli

If not, here are some https://developer.enonic.com/start[alternative ways to install Enonic CLI^]

To verify that the CLI has been installed, run `enonic -v`. This should output the version of your installed CLI.

To see all available options, simply run `enonic`.

TIP: To upgrade, use `enonic latest`. If there are new versions you will see instructions on how to upgrade.

== Create a sandbox

A sandbox is a local developer instance of our platform - Enonic XP. 

Each sandbox is isolated from the other ones and can run our platform in different versions.

Create a sandbox by running this command in your terminal:

  enonic sandbox create

Give it a name, i.e. `MySandbox`, and agree to continue with the most recent version of Enonic XP.

The CLI will proceed to download and setup your local developer instance, i.e, your sandbox.

After the download is finished, start the sandbox with this command:

  enonic sandbox start --dev

Select the `MySandbox` sandbox from the list, and it will boot up in development mode.

TIP: Dev mode will automatically load changes in your code when developing.

== Create the app

From a **new terminal window**, run the following command to create the application.

IMPORTANT: Use the default options when prompted.

  enonic project create -r tutorial-myfirstsite

[TIP]
====
The command uses the https://github.com/enonic/tutorial-myfirstsite[My first site^] Github repo  as a starter (template) for the app.
====

== Project structure

The project folder created should now contain a basic app structure, looking something like this:

[source,files]
----
build.gradle //<1>
build/ //<2>
code-samples/ //<3>
docs/ //<4>
src/
  main/
    resources/
      import/ //<5>
      assets/ //<6>
      sites/
        content-types/ //<7>
          country/
          city/
        parts/ //<8>
        pages/ //<9>
----

<1> gradle files are used by the app build system
<2> Contains output files produced by the build
<3> Code samples that will be used in this tutorial
<4> Contains the documentation you are reading now
<5> Contains sample content that is imported when the app starts
<6> Location for static assets
<7> Two pre-defined content types, country and city
<8> Part components - used to compose pages
<9> Page components - root component for pages

== Building, deploying and dev mode

=== Building

Assuming you did not change the default directory name `myproject/` when creating the app, build it with the following commands:

  cd myproject
  enonic project build


=== Deploying

Now, that you've built it, you can make the app available to your previsouly created sandbox by deploying it with

  enonic project deploy

Select the `MySandbox` sandbox from the list, and the app will use this from now on.

[NOTE]
====
Look for a line like this in the sandbox log to verify that the app has started:

  2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [company.starter.myfirstsite] installed successfully
====

=== Dev mode

From now on you'll be constantly updating the app, so to avoid the need to re-build and re-deploy every time you'd like to see the changes, start the project in `dev` mode by running:

  enonic project dev

TIP: For further details on the dev command, check the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/stable/dev#dev[CLI's dev command documentation]

== Install Content Studio

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It is not a part of the core platform, but as you will see soon, it can easily be installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^].

. **Open the sandbox admin**: http://localhost:8080/admin[http://localhost:8080/admin^] and click `Login without a user`. This will bring you to the Dashboard.
+
. **Open the Applications app** from the top right `XP menu -> Applications`.

. **Install Content Studio**: click `Install` button in the menu bar, scroll down to `Content Studio` (or use search) in the list of apps that appears and click `Install` next to it.

== Summary

You have installed the Enonic CLI, created your first sandbox using the latest XP version, deployed an app to that sandbox based on one of our starters, executed CLI commands to `build` your app , `deploy` it to your sandbox, and run the app in `dev` mode, and finally, installed Content Studio app.

That's a good start! 

Let's now use Content Studio to investigate our created app and its contents.
