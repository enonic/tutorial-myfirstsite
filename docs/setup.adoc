== Install Enonic CLI

The Command Line Interface is an essential tool for developers.

If you have `npm` on your device, run this command:

  npm install -g @enonic/cli

If not, here are some https://developer.enonic.com/start[alternative ways to install Enonic CLI^]

To verify that the CLI has been installed, run `enonic -v`. This should output the version of your installed CLI.

To see all available options, simply run `enonic`.

TIP: To upgrade, use `enonic latest`. If there are new versions you will see instructions on how to upgrade.

== Create a sandbox

A sandbox is a local developer instance of our platform - Enonic XP. Create a sandbox by running this command in your terminal:

  enonic sandbox create

Give it a name, i.e. `myfirstsite`, and select the most recent version of Enonic XP from the list that appears.

Start the sandbox with this command:

  enonic sandbox start --dev

Select the `intro` sandbox from the list, and it will boot up in development mode.

TIP: Dev mode will automatically load changes in your code when developing.

== Create app

From a **new terminal window**, run the following command to create the application.

IMPORTANT: Use the default options when prompted.

  enonic project create -r tutorial-myfirstsite

[TIP]
====
The command uses the https://github.com/enonic/tutorial-myfirstsite[My first site^] Github repo  as a starter (template) for the app.
====

== Project structure

The project folder created should now contain a basic app structure, looking something like this:

[source,files]
----
build.gradle //<1>
settings.gradle
build/ //<2>
code-samples/ //<3>
docs/ //<4>
src/
  main/
    resources/
      import/ //<5>
      assets/ //<6>
      sites/
        content-types/ //<7>
          country/
          city/
        parts/ //<8>
        pages/ //<9>
----

<1> gradle files are used by the app build system
<2> Contains output files produced by the build
<3> Code samples that will be used in this tutorial
<4> Contains the documentation you are reading now
<5> Contains sample content that is imported when the app starts
<6> Location for static assets
<7> Two pre-defined content types, country and city
<8> Part components - used to compose pages
<9> Page components - root component for pages

== Building and Deploying

Assuming you did not change the default directory name `myproject/` when creating the app - build and deploy the app with the following commands:

  cd myproject
  enonic project deploy

Select the `myfirstsite` sandbox from the list, and the app will use this from now on.

[NOTE]
====
Look for a line like this in the sandbox log to verify that the app has started:

  2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [com.example.myproject] installed successfully
====


== Install Content Studio

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It is not a part of the core platform, but as you will see soon, it can easily be installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^].

. **Open the sandbox admin**: http://localhost:8080/admin[http://localhost:8080/admin^] and click `Login without a user`. This will bring you to the Dashboard.
+
. **Open the Applications app** from the top right `XP menu -> Applications`.
