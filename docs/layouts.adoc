If you have the need to have a customizable part that also accept some regions, then a layout is the feature you're looking for.


== Two column layout

In this chapter, you'll be making a layout that has two columns, each column using a region to accept injectable content. We'll also support configuration of the part, so editors can control the sizes for each of those two columns.

. Let's start by **adding the descriptor** for the `two-columns` layout:
+
.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.xml[]
----
+
Notice that it doesn't change much from what you've seen so far. It's basically a mix of pages and parts. 
+
. Now, **add the controller**:
+
.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.ts[]
----
+
. **the view**:
+
.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.html
[source,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.html[]
----
+
. and finally, **some styling**:
+
.src/main/resources/assets/styles/two-columns.scss
[source,scss]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.scss[]
----

So far, the only section of code that is new is the `pageContributions` you see in the controller. 

Its naming speaks for itself, but just for clarity, is's a way to inject HTML on certain places within the markup. Those places are on the `head` tag begin or end, or on `body` tag begin or end.

In our case we used it to add a reference to the `two-columns.css` asset file (processed from `scss` to `css` during build), when this layout is placed on a page.

== Using the layout

So far you've understood what a layout is and, if followed along, created the code for a two column layout. Let's see in practice how you can add it to a page and use its regions.

. Go to the root site content and click on btn:[edit]
. Add the "Hello Regions!" page component, and insert the two-column layout in its main region:
+
image::two-column-layout.png["Two column layout with 50/50 config and no component in its left and right regions", width=1024px]
+
. Now add a text component to each region, and write some text:
+
image::two-column-layout-with-texts.png["Two column layout with 50/50 config and texts on its two left and right regions", width=1024px]

+
. Finally, select different configurations for the layout - Available options are: 33/66, 50/50 and 66/33 and check the results:
+
image::two-column-layout-33-66-with-texts.png["Two column layout with 33/66 config and texts on its two left and right regions", width=1024px]

== Text component

Above, we added Text components into the regions. The Text component is a standard component included in Enonic XP, it has standard rendering, but can be customized if needed.

== Summary


As already mentioned, regions accepts all kinds of parts, so by combining layouts with your custom parts, together with their own custom configurations, you can basically achieve any kind of design!
