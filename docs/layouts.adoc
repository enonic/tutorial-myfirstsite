= Layouts

Layouts are like parts, but also support regions

== Two column layout

In this chapter, you'll be making a layout with two columns. Each column declares a region to support more components. We'll also support configuration of the layout, so editors can control the sizes for each of those two columns.

. Let's start by **adding the descriptor** for the `two-columns` layout:
+
.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.xml[]
----
+
Notice that it doesn't change much from what you've seen so far. It's basically a mix of pages and parts. 
+
. **Add the controller**:
+
.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.ts[]
----
+
. **the view**:
+
.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.html
[source,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.html[]
----
+
. and finally, the layout needs **some styling**:
+
.src/main/resources/assets/styles/two-columns.scss
[source,scss]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.scss[]
----

So far, the only new section is the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/contributions[pageContributions] you see in the controller. 

Its naming speaks for itself, but just for clarity, is's a way for components to inject HTML on certain places within the resulting markup. Those places are on the `head` tag begin or end, or on `body` tag begin or end - and typically controlled by the page component.

In our case we used it to inject a reference to the `two-columns.css` asset when this layout is placed on a page.

NOTE: `scss` is automatically converted to `css` during build 

== Using the layout

So far you've understood what a layout is and, created the code for a two column layout. Let's see in practice by adding it to a page and using its regions.

. Go to the root site content and click on btn:[edit]
. *Setup the "Hello Regions!" page component*, and insert the two-column layout in its main region:
+
image::two-column-layout.png["Two column layout with 50/50 config and no component in its left and right regions", width=1024px]
+
. *Add a text component to each region*, and write some text:
+
image::two-column-layout-with-texts.png["Two column layout with 50/50 config and texts on its two left and right regions", width=1024px]

+
. Finally, *try out the different configuration options* `33/66`, `50/50` and `66/33` and check the results:
+
image::two-column-layout-33-66-with-texts.png["Two column layout with 33/66 config and texts on its two left and right regions", width=1024px]

== Summary


As already mentioned, regions accepts all kinds of parts, so by combining layouts with your custom parts, together with their own custom configurations, you can basically achieve any kind of design!
