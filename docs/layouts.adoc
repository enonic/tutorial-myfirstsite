== Layouts: parts with regions

If you have the need to have a customizable part that also accept some regions, then a layout is the feature you're looking for.

Our goal from now on will be to come up with a layout with a custom config for two columns, each column using a region to accept injectable content. The custom config will be responsible to set the sizes for each of those two columns.

Let's start by defining the descriptor for the `two-columns` layout:

.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.xml[]
----

note that it doesn't change much from what you've seen so far... It's basically a mix of what you saw on pages and parts chapters. Now let's define the controller:

.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.ts[]
----

the view:

.src/main/resources/site/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.html
[source,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.html[]
----

and finally, make sure to add the styling:

.src/main/resources/assets/styles/two-columns.scss
[source,scss]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/layouts/two-columns/two-columns.scss[]
----

So far, the only section of code that is new is the `pageContributions` in the controller. 

Its naming speaks for itself, but just for clarity, that's a way to add specific html on certain places before the server serves the final HTML... those certain places are: on `head` tag begin or end, or on `body` tag begin or end.

In our case we used it to add the `two-columns.css` asset file (processed from `scss` to `css` during build) when this layout is used on a page.

== Using the layout

So far you've understood what a layout is and, if followed along, created the code for a two column layout. Let's see in practice how you can add it to a page and use its regions.

. Go to the root site content and click on btn:[edit]
. Make sure you have the "Hello Regions!" page added to that content, and insert the two-column layout in its main region:
+
image::two-column-layout.png["Two column layout with 50/50 config and no component in its left and right regions", width=1024px]
+
. Now add some text components to both regions, and write some text:
+
image::two-column-layout-with-texts.png["Two column layout with 50/50 config and texts on its two left and right regions", width=1024px]

+
. Finally, select different configurations for the sizing of those columns: 33/66, 50/50 and 66/33 and check the results:
+
image::two-column-layout-33-66-with-texts.png["Two column layout with 33/66 config and texts on its two left and right regions", width=1024px]

== Summary

Note that in our example we added a text component part in the regions of the layout, which is a standard part that is shipped with Enonic XP, but you are not restricted to that.

As already mentioned, regions accepts all kinds of parts, so by combining layouts with your custom parts, together with their own custom configurations, you can basically achieve any kind of design!
