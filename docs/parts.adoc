= Parts - flexible components for your pages

Parts are the visual building blocks to make pages more interesting.

== The country part

It's about time we show some details from the *Country* content type.

Rather than making another page component, lets use parts. Like the Text component, parts can be added to regions.

A descriptor, controller and view have already been added to the `src/main/resources/site/parts/` folder:

.src/main/resources/site/parts/country/country.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/country/country.xml[]
----

.src/main/resources/site/parts/country/country.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}/country/country.ts[]
----

.src/main/resources/site/parts/country/country.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/country/country.html[]
----

*Add the part to the country page* by drag'n'dropping `Part` from the right-hand-side. Then select the `Country` component from the list.

The resulting page should look something like this:

image::country-part-on-columbia.png["Result of inserting the country part on the columbia country content item",width=300px]

NOTE: You may also use the page component input (visible on the left hand , or floating above the page editor) to manage the components on your page.

image::page-component-input.png["Page component input,tree structure to manage components on the page",width=500px]
== Configurable part

Let's try something slightly more advanced. The `City list` part will:

* list cities within a country,
* show an image of each city,
* let you choose the image cropping format.

The part already exists in your app via the following files:

.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/city-list/city-list.xml[]
----

.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}/city-list/city-list.ts[]
----

.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/city-list/city-list.html[]
----


. *Add the city list part* to the same page as before, and verify that it is working.
. *Configure the part* by changing the settings in the right hand panel, e.g. choose `widescreen` in the "Image crop" dropdown. Click Apply button to see the result.


image::city-list-part-on-columbia.png["Result of adding city list part to page and configure it to show widescreen images", width=1227px]

== Image service

Images are scaled and cropped in real-time by the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/site-engine/image-service[Image service^]. The part controller uses the `imageUrl()` function to create a link to the desired image, with desired sizes and cropping.

== Logging

The controller above also outputs the `model object` to the log. Check your sandbox log after visiting a country page to see what is going on.

== Summary

You've been introduced to parts, a powerful concept that will enable you to build customizable visual blocks for your pages.
