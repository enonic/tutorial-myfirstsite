== Parts: configurable components

You're now ready to present some more information from the *Country* content type.

Rather than making another page component, let's create a `part`. Parts are essentially components that can be added to regions.

. Create the folder `src/main/resources/site/parts/country/` in your project.
. Add the part schema, controller and view files below to the folder:
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/country/country.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/country/country.xml[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/country/country.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/country/country.ts[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/country/country.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/country/country.html[]
----
+
. When done, the part can be added to the page by drag'n dropping a part component from the right-hand-side, then select the `Country` component from the list. By the end, you should have something like this:
+
image::country-part-on-columbia.png["Result of inserting the country part on the columbia country content item",width=512px]


== Configurable part

Let's try something slightly more advanced.

In this task, you'll add a new part that does the following:

* Lists cities within a country.
* Supports configuation for image cropping format
* Includes a real-time cropped image of each city

Complete the steps below to try it out:

. Create the `City list` part by adding the schema, controller and view files:
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/city-list/city-list.xml[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/city-list/city-list.ts[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/city-list/city-list.html[]
----
+
. Add the new part to the page you created earlier.
. Finally, configure the part by selecting it and changing the settings in the right hand panel.
+
NOTE: The controller is also configured to log model passed to the view, check sandbox log after visiting a country page to see what is happening.
+
image::city-list-part-on-columbia.png["Result of adding city list part to page and configure it to show widescreen images", width=1024px]
+
TIP: The images are scaled and cropped in real-time by the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/site-engine/image-service[Image service^]. The part controller uses the `imageUrl()` function to create a link to the desired image.

== Summary

You've been introduced to parts, a powerful concept that will enable you to build customizable dynamic ui blocks for your application.

Next you'll learn about layouts, which are basically parts that also accepts regions.
