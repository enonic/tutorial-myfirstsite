== Parts

You're now ready to present some more information from the *Country* content type.

Rather than making another page component, let's create a `part`. Parts are essentially components that can be added to regions.

. Create the folder `src/main/resources/site/parts/country/` in your project.
. Add the part controller and view files below to the folder:
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/country/country.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/country/country.ts[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/country/country.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/country/country.html[]
----
+
. When done, the part can be added to the page by drag'n dropping a part component from the right-hand-side, then select the `Country` component from the list.

== Configurable part

Let's try something slightly more advanced.

In this task, you'll add a new part that does the following:

* Lists cities within a country.
* Supports configuation for image cropping format
* Includes a real-time cropped image of each city

Complete the steps below to try it out:

. Create the `City list` part by adding the controller and view files:
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.js
[source,js]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/city-list/city-list.js[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/city-list/city-list.html[]
----
+
. This time, also add a component descriptor.
This descriptor includes a form (similar to a content type). The form allow editors to configure the part, once it is placed on the page.
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/city-list/city-list.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/parts/city-list/city-list.xml[]
----
+
. Add the new part to the page you created earlier.
. Finally, configure the part by selecting it and changing the settings in the right hand panel.
+
NOTE: The controller is also configured to log model passed to the view, check sandbox log after visiting a country page to see what is happening.

TIP: The images are scaled and cropped in real-time by the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/site-engine/image-service[Image service^]. The part controller uses the `imageUrl()` function to create a link to the desired image.
