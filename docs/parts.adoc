= Parts - flexible components for your pages

Parts are the visual building blocks to make pages more interesting.

== The country part

It's about time we show some details from the *Country* content type.

Rather than making another page component, lets use parts. Like the Text component, parts can be added to regions.

A descriptor, controller and view have already been added to the `src/main/resources/site/parts/` folder:

.parts/country/country.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/country/country.xml[]
----

.parts/country/country.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}/country/country.ts[]
----

.parts/country/country.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/country/country.html[]
----

*Add the part to the country page* by drag'n dropping `Part` from the right-hand-side. Then select the `Country` component from the list. 

The resulting page should look something like this:

image::country-part-on-columbia.png["Result of inserting the country part on the columbia country content item",width=300px]

NOTE: You may also use the page form input (visible on the left hand , or floating above the page editor) to manage the components on your page.

== Configurable part

Let's try something slightly more advanced. The `City list` part will:

* Lists cities within a country.
* Show an image of each city
* Let you choose the image cropping format

The part already exists in your app via the following files:

.parts/city-list/city-list.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/city-list/city-list.xml[]
----

.parts/city-list/city-list.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}/city-list/city-list.ts[]
----

.parts/city-list/city-list.html
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/city-list/city-list.html[]
----


. *Add the city list part* to the same page as before, and verify that it is working.
. *Configure the part* by changing the settings in the right hand panel. i.e. by choosing `widescreen`. Click apply to see the result.

== Image service

Images are scaled and cropped in real-time by the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/site-engine/image-service[Image service^]. The part controller uses the `imageUrl()` function to create a link to the desired image, with desired sizes and cropping.

== Logging

The controller above also prints the `model object` to the log. Check your sandbox log after visiting a country page to see what is going on

== Summary

You've been introduced to parts, a powerful concept that will enable you to build customizable dynamic ui blocks for your pages.
