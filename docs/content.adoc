= Content Studio and Content Types

Introduction to Content Studio, content types and content items

== Content Studio

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It is not a part of the core platform, but can easily be installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^].

. **Open the sandbox admin**: http://localhost:8080/admin[http://localhost:8080/admin^] and click `Login without a user`. This will bring you to the Dashboard.
+
. **Open the Applications app** from the top right `XP menu -> Applications`.

Your XP `Dashboard` should now have a `Content Studio widget`, and `Content Studio` available from the right-hand-side XP menu.

== Content and projects

A content project called `My First Site` and some sample content gets created when your application starts the first time. Let's have a closer look. 

**Open Content Studio** from the right hand `XP menu -> Content Studio`. You should now see some of the imported content.

A content structure, with `Hello World` as the root item show now appear. From the content icon, one can recognize that this is a site. Expanding the site will reveal `Columbia, Norway, USA` and `Templates` as child items. 

TIP: ignore the `Templates` folder for now, we'll get back to it later. 


== Sites + Apps = true

Select the hello-world content and click btn:[edit].

From the left hand from, you can see that your app `My first site`, has been added to the site. This gives Content Studio access to any goodies the app might contain. One such goodie is additional content types.

== Content Types

Every content item has a specific a content type. You app contains two content types: `Country` and `City`. They are defined under `src/main/resources/site/content-types`.

Enonic XP ships with a limited set of standard content types such as `Shortcut`, `Folder`, `Site`, and a range of `Media Types` that handle different kind of files. Additionally, an application may define its own custom content types. 

Let's explore the `City` content type. In Content Studio it should look something like this:

image::city-form.png["Form for the city content type", width=920px]

The content type is defined in a descriptor file, looking like this:

.src/main/resources/site/content-types/city/city.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/content-types/city/city.xml[]
----

Now that you understand the basics of content and content types, use Content Studio to create a new `Country` of your choosing. Then, add a `City` (or more) within it.


== Summary

You've been introduced to content items and content types, and even created some content based on the content types from your application.

TIP: For more details visit the reference documentation for https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types[content types^] and https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas[the schema system^].

Let's now move forward to previewing or rendering the existing content. To do that, we'll start with <<pages#, the concept of Pages>>.
