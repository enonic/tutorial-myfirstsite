= Content Studio and Content Types

Introduction to Content Studio, content types, and content items

== Content Studio

Your application creates a content project called `My First Site` the first time it starts. Let's have a closer look.

*Open Content Studio* from the right hand `XP menu -> Content Studio`. You should now see some of the imported content.

A content structure with `Hello World` as the root item will now appear. From the content icon, one can recognize that this is a site. Expanding the site will reveal `Columbia, Norway, USA` and `Templates` as child items.

TIP: Ignore the `Templates` folder for now.  We'll get back to it later.


== Sites and apps

Select the "Hello World" content and click btn:[edit].

From the left-hand form, you can see that your app `My first site` has been added to the site. This gives Content Studio access to any goodies the app might contain, for instance, additional content types.

== Content Types

Every content item has a specific content type.

Enonic XP ships with a set of standard content types:  `Shortcut`, `Folder`, `Site`, and a selection of `Media Types`. Media types handle different kinds of files.

Additionally, applications may define their own custom content types. Your app contains two: `Country` and `City`. They are defined under `src/main/resources/site/content-types/`. Let's explore the `City` content type. In Content Studio, it should look something like this:

image::city-form.png["Form for the city content type", width=920px]

The content type is defined in a descriptor file, looking like this:

.src/main/resources/site/content-types/city/city.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/content-types/city/city.xml[]
----

Now that you understand the basics of content and content types, use Content Studio to create a new `Country` of your choosing. Then, add a `City` (or more) within it.


== Summary

You've been introduced to content items and content types and even created some content based on the content types from your application.

TIP: For more details, visit the reference documentation for https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types[content types^] and https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas[the schema system^].

Let's now move forward to previewing or rendering the existing content. To do that, we'll start with <<pages#, the concept of Pages>>.
