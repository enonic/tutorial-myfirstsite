= Content Studio and Content Types

Introduction to Content Studio, content types and content items

== Content Studio

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It is not a part of the core platform, but as you will see soon, it can easily be installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^].

. **Open the sandbox admin**: http://localhost:8080/admin[http://localhost:8080/admin^] and click `Login without a user`. This will bring you to the Dashboard.
+
. **Open the Applications app** from the top right `XP menu -> Applications`.

== Content and projects

Your XP `Dashboard` should now have a `Content Studio widget`, indicating that you already have some sample content available.

A content project called `My First Site` and the sample content gets imported when your application was started the first time. Let's have a closer look. 

**Open Content Studio** from the right hand `XP menu -> Content Studio`. You should now see some of the imported content.

You should now see a content structure, with `Hello World` as the root item. From the icon, you can recognize that this is a site. Expanding the site will reveal `Columbia, Norway, USA and Templates` as child items. 

TIP: ignore the `Templates` folder for now, we'll getback to it later. 

Select the hello-world content and click btn:[edit].

Because your `My first site` app has been added to the site, you get access all the goodies from the app within the site. One of these goodies is the ability to create new types of content. 

== Content Types

Every content item has a specific a content type. You app contains two content types: `Country` and `City`. They are defined under `src/main/resources/site/content-types`.

Enonic XP ships with a limited set of standard content types such as `Shortcut`, `Folder`, `Site`, and a range of `Media Types` that handle different kind of files. Additionally, an application may define its own custom content types. 

Let's explore the `City` content type. In Content Studio it should look something like this:

image::city-form.png["Form for the city content type", width=920px]

The content type is defined in a descriptor file, looking like this:

.src/main/resources/site/content-types/city/city.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/site/content-types/city/city.xml[]
----

Now that you understand the basics of content and content types, use Content Studio to create a new `Country`. Then, add a `City` (or more) within it.

== Summary

You've been introduced to content items and content types, and even created some content based on the content types from your application.

Let's now move forward to previewing or rendering the existing content. To do that, we'll start with <<pages#, the concept of Pages>>.
