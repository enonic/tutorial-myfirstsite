= Page templates

Create page templates to reuse a page across different content items

== Reusable pages
Previously, we mentioned that you'd get to know about the `Templates` folder a bit later. The time has arrived.

With our current approach, you would have to configure a new page for every country in the list. A slightly more efficient approach is to use page templates.

By creating a page template, and mapping it to a specific content type i.e. countries - all countries will be rendered by the page template.

Let's create a page template for the country content type:

. Select the `Templates` content item and then click on btn:[new]
+
image::page-template-1.png["List of content types under the root site content, with the Templates highlighted", width=1024px]
+
. Select the `Page template` content type
+
image::page-template-2.png["Modal showing the page template content type", width=1024px]
+
. On supports, select `Country` content type and click on `Apply`
+
image::page-template-3.png["List of available content types under the support filter, with the Country content type highlighted", width=1024px]
+
. On the right section, select the `Hello Regions!` page
+
image::page-template-4.png["List of available pages, with the Hello Regions! page highlighted", width=1024px]
+
. Right click on `Drop here` region in the added page, then `insert` and `part` and select the `Country` part
+
image::page-template-5.png["List of available parts to be added withing a region, with the Country part highlighted", width=1024px]
+
. Then finally give this page template a name, such as "Country Page Template" and save it.

NOTE: Try clicking the other countries to verify that the template actually works as intended.

== Toggle template

The country item you edited still uses the custom page you created - you can change this one to use the new page template as well.

. Edit the initial country, open the page editor and select the page.
. From the right hand component view, change the "Template" setting from "Custom" to "Automatic"

NOTE: For every single content item, you can use `Automatic` (default), select a `specific template`, or `customize` the page.

== Summary

You've just learned about page templates, which is a way to reuse a page across specific content types within your site. This is a powerful feature of the CMS, as it enables editors to manage and publish page templates, just like any other content.
