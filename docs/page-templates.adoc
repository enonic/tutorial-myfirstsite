= Page templates

Create page templates to reuse a page across different content items

== Reusable pages
Previously, we mentioned that you'd get to know about the `Templates` folder a bit later. The time has arrived.

With the current approach, you would have to configure a new page for every country in the list. A slightly more efficient approach is to use page templates. Page templates can be mapped to a specific content type i.e. country - and all countries will be rendered by it.

Let's take advantage over the fact that we have already created a page for a city. 

. Select, and btn:[Edit] the City with the page
. Select the page component, and from the context menu click btn:[Save as Template]
. Give your Template a suitable name i.e. `Country template`
. In the `Supported content types` field, choose `Country`.

Here is a video demonstrating the process.

Now, all of your cities will be rendered by the page template.

== From scratch
Just like any other piece of content, a page template can also be created from scratch.

. Select the `Templates` content item and then click btn:[new]

+
. Select the `Page template` content type

+
. On supports, select `Country` content type and click on `Apply`
+

+
. On the right section, select the `Hello Regions!` page
+

+
. Right click on `Drop here` region in the added page, then `insert` and `part` and select the `Country` part
+

+
. Then finally give this page template a name, such as "Country Page Template" and save it.

NOTE: Try clicking the other countries to verify that the template actually works as intended.


== Automatic, fixed or customized

The country item you manually edited still uses the custom page you created - you can make it use the page template as well.

. Edit the initial country, open the page editor and select the page.
. From the right hand component view, change the Template setting from `Custom` to `Automatic`

NOTE: For every single content item, you can use `Automatic` (default), select a `specific template`, or `customize` the page.

== Summary

You've just learned about page templates, which is a way to reuse a page across specific content types within your site. This is a powerful feature of the CMS, as it enables editors to manage and publish page templates, just like any other content.

TIP: If you want to control the rendering of certain pages without using page templates, check out https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/mappings[controller mappings^].
