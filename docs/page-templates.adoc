== Page templates: mapping content types to views

On the Content types chapter we mentioned that you'd get to know the `Templates` child content of the root site later... now's the time!

With our current approach, you would have to configure a new page for every country in the list. A slightly more efficient approach is to use page templates.

By creating a page template, and map it to a specific content types, all items of this type - i.e. countries - will be rendered by the page template.

Let's create a page template for the country content type:

. Select the `Templates` content item and then click on btn:[new]
+
image::page-template-1.png["List of content types under the root site content, with the Templates highlighted", width=1024px]
+
. Select the `Page template` content type
+
image::page-template-2.png["Modal showing the page template content type", width=1024px]
+
. On supports, select `Country` content type and click on `Apply`
+
image::page-template-3.png["List of available content types under the support filter, with the Country content type highlighted", width=1024px]
+
. On the right section, select the `Hello Regions!` page
+
image::page-template-4.png["List of available pages, with the Hello Regions! page highlighted", width=1024px]
+
. Right click on `Drop here` region in the added page, then `insert` and `part` and select the `Country` part
+
image::page-template-5.png["List of available parts to be added withing a region, with the Country part highlighted", width=1024px]
+
. Then finally give this page template a name, such as "Country Page Template" and save it.

NOTE: Try clicking the other countries to verify that the template actually works as intended.

== Toggle template

Your originally edited country still uses the custom page you created - you can change it to use the new page template as well.

. Edit the initial country, open the page editor and select the page.
. From the right hand component view, change the "Template" setting from "Custom" to "Automatic"


NOTE: For each content item, you can select a specific template, or customize the presentation at any time.

== Summary

You've just learned about page templates, which is a way to map certain configurations of views to the existing content types of your application.

This is a crucial feature of the CMS since its usage guarantees consistency of views throughout same types of contents.
