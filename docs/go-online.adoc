What just happened? In Content Studio, you work in the draft branch. When publishing, the selected items are merged from *draft* to the *master* branch

NOTE: You can see the published site and the master branch on this url: `http://localhost:8080/site/myfirstsite/master/hello-world`.

*Well done!*

 ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on building your first Enonic site - The Enonic team.
