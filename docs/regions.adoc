== Regions

Content Studio's page editor also supports adding more components to a page, using drag'n drop.

To support this, the page component must define one or more regions.

Complete the steps below to add a single region called `main` to the `hello` page component.

. Start off by **adding a component descriptor**. The descriptor statically declares the region:
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.xml[]
----
+
. **Update your controller and view** with the code below to support the new region:
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.js
[source,js]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.js[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html:
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.html[]
----
+
Your sandbox should automatially pickup the changes, as we are running in dev mode.
+
. Back in Content Studio, select, and **edit one of the contry content items**.
. Activate the page editor (from the top right monitor icon) and select the `Hello` component.

You now have a page with a region. Try adding a text component to the region. It is available from the right hand side as drag-n-drop, or by using the right click menu.
