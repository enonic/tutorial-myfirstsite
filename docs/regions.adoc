= Regions

Create component hierarchies with the power of regions.

== Component dropzones

Content Studio also supports adding more components to a page. To get going, the page component must define one or more regions.

Complete the steps below to add a single region called `main` to the `hello` page component.

. Start off by **updating your page component descriptor**. The new descriptor (below) statically declares the region:
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.xml[]
----
+
. **Update your controller and view** with the code below to support the region:
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.ts[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html:
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.html[]
----
+
Your sandbox should automatially pickup the changes, as we are running in dev mode.
+
. Back in Content Studio, select, and **edit one of the country content items**.
. Activate the page editor (from the top right monitor icon), and select the `Hello` component.
+

+
Sweet. You now have a page with a single region! 

== Text component

To make use of your new and shiny region, lets fill it with some content

. *Add a text component* to the region. It is available from the right hand side as drag-n-drop, or by using the right click menu.

The Text component is a standard component included in Enonic XP, it has standard rendering, but can be customized if needed.

Visit the reference documentation for https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/pages/text[more details on the Text Component^].


== Summary

You've been introduced to regions, a concept that can be used on a page, as you just saw, but also on layouts, a new component type you'll be introduced to soon.

TIP: To learn more about regions, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/pages/regions[regions documentation^].

In the next chapter you'll <<parts#, learn about parts>>. A highly customizable component type that can be inserted into regions.
