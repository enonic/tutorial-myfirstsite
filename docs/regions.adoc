= Regions

Support adding more components to your page, including drag'n drop.

== Component dropzones

Content Studio supports adding more components to a page.
To enable this, a page component must define one or more regions.

Complete the steps below to add a single region called `main` to the `hello` page component.

. Start off by **adding a component descriptor**. The descriptor statically declares the region:
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.xml[]
----
+
. **Update your controller and view** with the code below to support the new region:
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.ts
[source,ts]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.ts[]
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html:
[source,HTML]
----
include::{sourcedir}code-samples/pages/hello-region/hello.html[]
----
+
Your sandbox should automatially pickup the changes, as we are running in dev mode.
+
. Back in Content Studio, select, and **edit one of the country content items**.
. Activate the page editor (from the top right monitor icon), and select the `Hello` component.
+
image::hello-regions.gif["Setting up a page with a region", width=1024px]
+
You now have a page with a single region! 
+
. Try to *add a text component to the region*. It is available from the right hand side as drag-n-drop, or by using the right click menu.

TIP: To learn more about regions, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/pages/regions[regions] documentation.


== Text component

Above, we added a text component into the region. The Text component is a standard component included in Enonic XP, it has standard rendering, but can be customized if needed.

Visit the refrence documentation for https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/pages/text[more details on the Text Component^].


== Summary

You've been introduced to regions, a concept that can be used on a page, as you just saw, but also on layouts, a new component type you'll be introduced to soon.

In the next chapter you'll <<parts#, learn about parts>>. A highly customizable component type that can be inserted into regions.
